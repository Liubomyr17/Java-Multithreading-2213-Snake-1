/*

Snake 1

Now let's write a snake game.
For this we need:
Actually the snake itself (snake class)
The room in which it will crawl (class Room)
Misha, who will she be (class Mouse)

Create a classy Snake, Room, Mouse
Remember to create the public static void main (String [] args) method in the Room class.
